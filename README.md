# Left Behind

In Left Behind, the earth faces imminent destruction as a colossal asteroid hurtles towards the planet. As the clock ticks down, you control a rescue vehicle tasked with extracting as many citizens as possible and delivering them to rockets before the impending impact. The game begins in an eerie calm, with unaware citizens and a quiet landscape, but as the countdown continues, the environment becomes chaoticâ€”debris falls, panic spreads, and the race against time intensifies. You must navigate obstacles, avoid hazards, and make quick decisions to save humanity before the ultimate disaster strikes.
