# CrashLander

In a distant future where space exploration is a necessity for humanity's survival, you are an elite astronaut known as the "CrashLander," part of an advanced scouting unit tasked with exploring uncharted planets. After a catastrophic malfunction in your spacecraft, you are forced to crash-land on a series of unknown worlds. Each planet is vastly different in size, environment, and dangers, requiring you to adapt quickly to survive.

After the crash, you find yourself stranded on a mysterious planet teeming with hostile creatures and hazardous terrain. Each new world presents unique challenges and treacherous landscapes that test your skills and resilience. As you journey through these planets, you discover clues about a long-lost civilization that once thrived across the galaxy. This civilization left behind powerful relics, each guarded by formidable enemies. To unlock the secrets of these relics, you must conquer each planet, scale its challenges, and gather the knowledge needed to repair your ship and escape the star system.
